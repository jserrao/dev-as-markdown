## Dev as Markdown

I've long jotted notes about how to do dev correctly and I'm trying to adapt to the world of agent-first coding. To that end I'm codifying good articles and how-tos by first reading them, playing around a bit and having LLMs summarize the best stuff I'm finding into rule set for future implementations.

The idea with the repo is to refine the rulesets into a kind of superset of the best development practices in the technologies I'm using the most. This is hardly novel but everyone's flow is a slightly different so this repo is focused on the tools I'm using most heavily right now, which are Typescript, React, Shaders and improving at animation in general.

Any contributions are welcome.
